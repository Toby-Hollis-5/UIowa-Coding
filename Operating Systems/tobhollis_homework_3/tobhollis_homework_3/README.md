task 1: FIFO & LRU Replacement algorithms
Compiling: To compile task1, navigate to task1.c file in the folder tobhollis_homework_3/task1/ in a terminal. Then, type "gcc task1.c -o task1". This will compile the task1.c program file and output into a "task1" file. This will print out the output in the terminal.
Dependencies: None.
Other things to know: To change the number of frames for any replacement algorithm, simply change the defined variable at the top of the file "num_frames"!

task 2: Second Chance Replacement algorithms
Compiling: To compile task1, navigate to task2.c file in the folder tobhollis_homework_3/task2/ in a terminal. Then, type "gcc task2.c -o task2". This will compile the task2.c program file and output into a "task2" file. This will print out the output in the terminal.
Dependencies: None.
Other things to know: To change the number of frames for any replacement algorithm, simply change the defined variable at the top of the file "num_frames"!

task 3: Enhanced Second Chance Replacement algorithms
Compiling: To compile task3, navigate to task3.c file in the folder tobhollis_homework_3/task3/ in a terminal. Then, type "gcc task3.c -o task3". This will compile the task1.c program file and output into a "task3" file. This will print out the output in the terminal.
Dependencies: None.
Other things to know: To change the number of frames for any replacement algorithm, simply change the defined variable at the top of the file "num_frames"!

Task 4 & 5: PDFs of task 4 and 5 are included in the tobhollis/homework_3/ folder.
