task1: shell
Compiling:
To compile task1, one must navigate to the task1.c file in the folder tobhollis/task2/ in a terminal. Then, type "gcc task1.c -o task1". This will compile the task1.c program file and output into a task2 file. This will allow us to start the shell program.
Dependencies: None. Just standard C library on Linux.


task2: process monitor
Compiling: 
To compile task2, one must navigate to the task2.c file in the folder tobhollis/task2/ in a terminal. Then, type "gcc task2.c -o task2". This will compile the task2.c program file and output into a task2 file. This will allow us to see the output by typing "./task2" into the terminal. The output is formatted and organized by PID, with each PID also showing the Executable Path and the number of Context Switches made.
Dependencies: None. Just standard C library on Linux.


task3: GUI
Compiling:
I could not figure out how to create a GUI and/or compile it on Linux.
