Task 1: SJF & SRJF
Compiling: To compile task1, one must navigate to the schedule.c file in the folder tobhollis_homework_2/task1/ in a terminal. Then, type "gcc schedule.c -o schedule". This will compile the schedule.c program file and output into a "schedule" file. This will print out the output in the terminal.
Dependencies: None.
Other things to know: The original Process struct was changed in my program. I added an extra 'time_remaining' int to each process. I hope this was OK; please add these to any test cases used.

Task 2: SJF & SRJF averages
Compiling: To compile task2, one must navigate to the schedule.c file in the folder tobhollis_homework_2/task2/ in a terminal. Then, type "gcc schedule.c -o schedule". This will compile the schedule.c program file and output into a "schedule" file. This will print out the output in the terminal.
Dependencies: None.
Other things to know: The original Process struct was changed in my program. I added an extra 'time_remaining' int to each process. I hope this was OK; please add these to any test cases used.

Best scheduling algorithms: The algorithm that performs best in terms of turnaround time is SRJF. This is because the algorithm prioritizes processes with smaller burst times, therefore resulting in smaller turnaround times.

Task 3: MLQ
Compiling: To compile task3, one must navigate to the mlq.c file in the folder tobhollis_homework_2/task3/ in a terminal. Then, type "gcc mlq.c -o mlq". This will compile the mlq.c program file and output into a "mlq" file. This will print out the output in the terminal.
Dependencies: None.
Other things to know: The original Process struct was changed in my program. I added an extra 'time_remaining' int to each process. I hope this was OK; please add these to any test cases used.
